Profiler
===============================================================================
`profiling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)>`_ is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization.
